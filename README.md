Objective:
Students will apply debugging tools and strategies to identify and fix errors in a pre-written JavaScript application. The exercise emphasizes using the Console, Sources tab, debugger statement, and practical strategies like isolating problematic code and testing edge cases.



Scenario
You are tasked with debugging a simple JavaScript application for an e-commerce platform. The application calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart, applies discounts, and generates a receipt. Unfortunately, the application has several bugs that cause it to malfunction. Your job is to:
1. Identify and fix errors using browser developer tools.
2. Analyze the error messages and call stack for debugging insights.
3. Test edge cases to ensure the program functions correctly.



Instructions
Setup the Debugging Environment:
Open the HTML file in a browser and use Developer Tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) to debug.



Tasks
1. Identify Errors:
  Use the Console tab to locate syntax and runtime errors.
  Use the Sources tab to set breakpoints in the calculateTotal, applyDiscount, and generateReceipt functions.

2. Debug and Fix Errors:
  Analyze error messages and the call stack to understand the root cause.
  Use the debugger statement to pause execution in loops and inspect variable values.

3. Validate Fixes:
  Test the corrected program with the given cart and a few edge cases:
    An empty cart.
    A cart with one item.
    A discountRate of 0 or 1.

4. Write a Summary:
  Document the errors you found and how you fixed them.
  Explain how debugging tools helped you locate and resolve issues.
